## Deploy to Azure

The easiest way to deploy this app is using the [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azd).  If you open this repo in GitHub CodeSpaces the AZD tooling is already preinstalled.

To provision and deploy:
1) Open a new terminal and do the following from root folder:
```bash
azd up
```
## Run Locally

### Pre-reqs
1) [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/) required 
2) [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=v4%2Cmacos%2Ccsharp%2Cportal%2Cbash#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools)
3) [Azurite](https://github.com/Azure/Azurite)
4) Once you have your Azure subscription, run the following in a new terminal window to create all the AI Language and other resources needed:
```bash
azd provision
```

Take note of the value of `TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT` which can be found in `./.azure/<env name from azd provision>/.env`.  It will look something like:
```bash
TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT="https://<unique string>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
```

Alternatively you can [create a Language resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics) in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. After it deploys, click Go to resource and view the Endpoint value.

5) [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/storage-explorer/) or storage explorer features of [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
6) Add this `local.settings.json` file to the `./sensitive_data_processor` folder to simplify local development.  Optionally fill in the AI_URL and AI_SECRET values per step 4.  This file will be gitignored to protect secrets from committing to your repo.  
```json
{
    "IsEncrypted": false,
    "Values": {
        "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
        "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "python",
        "TEXT_ANALYTICS_ENDPOINT": "<insert from step 4>"
    }
}
```

### Using VS Code
1) Open the root folder in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```
2) Ensure `local.settings.json` exists already using steps above
3) Run and Debug by pressing `F5`
4) Open Storage Explorer, Storage Accounts -> Emulator -> Blob Containers -> and create a container `unprocessed-text` if it does not already exists
5) Copy any .txt document file with text into the `unprocessed-text` container

You will see AI analysis happen in the Terminal standard out.  The analysis will be saved in a .txt file in the `processed-text` blob container.

### Using Functions Core Tools CLI
0) Ensure `local.settings.json` exists already using steps above
1) Open a new terminal and do the following:

```bash
cd sensitive_data_processor
func start
```
2) Open Storage Explorer, Storage Accounts -> Emulator -> Blob Containers -> and create a container `test-samples-trigger` if it does not already exists
3) Copy any .txt document file with text into the `test-samples-trigger` container

You will see AI analysis happen in the Terminal standard out.  The analysis will be saved in a .txt file in the `test-samples-output` blob container.
